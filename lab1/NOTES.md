# Lab 1 Learning Notes

## Environment Setup

### System Information
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 (Native Linux)
- PostgreSQL: Version 15
- DBeaver: Version 25.3.3
- Git: Version 2.43.0

### Installation Experience
- PostgreSQL was already installed on my system
- DBeaver successfully connected to localhost:5432
- Git was pre-installed, just needed configuration

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills Acquired
1. **PostgreSQL Setup:** Successfully connected DBeaver to PostgreSQL database
2. **SQL Basics:** Created students table with constraints (PRIMARY KEY, CHECK)
3. **Git Workflow:** Initialized repository, understanding add/commit/push workflow

### Challenges Faced
1. **Challenge:** Understanding the difference between working in DBeaver vs creating SQL files
   - **Solution:** Learned that SQL files are for version control and reproducibility
   - **Lesson:** DBeaver is a tool for testing; SQL files are the actual deliverable

## AI Usage Reflection
- Used Claude AI for assignment guidance and step-by-step instructions
- AI helped understand the purpose of creating SQL files vs GUI work
- Learned proper Git workflow and repository structure
- AI explained the relationship between terminal work, DBeaver, and GitHub

## Database Work Summary
- Created `students` table with 5 sample records
- Practiced 7 different SQL queries including:
  - Filtering with WHERE
  - Sorting with ORDER BY
  - Aggregation with GROUP BY and AVG()
  - Multi-condition queries with IN clause

## Next Steps
- Push repository to GitHub
- Take required screenshots for PDF submission
- Complete AI Learning Log documentation
- Export database schema
